# 07-FCC-project6-Weather-app

Weather app project from FreeCodeCamp.

I trained several ajax requests with this project. The location is determined with the IP of the client instead of using the GeoLocation of modern browsers.
Its fully responsive. I spend some time taking care of the layout in mobile devices.
